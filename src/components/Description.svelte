  Wes Anderson's masterful eye for crafting a scene is evident in all of his
  movies. His style has become instantly recognizable and inspired admiring
  Instagram accounts, analyses and articles on his own inspirations. <br />

  This timeline of his movies shows each one's reception - both critical (Rotten
  Tomatoes score) and financial (budget and box office numbers). In only two occasions
  has his budget exceeded the box office amount reaped - his first movie,
  <em>Bottle Rocket</em>, and <em>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</em>.
