<div class="title">Wes Anderson: Many Hits, Few Misses<br /><br /></div>
<div class="text">
  Wes Anderson's masterful eye for crafting a scene is evident in all of his
  movies. His style has become instantly recognizable and has inspired admiring
  Instagram accounts such as @accidentallywesanderson and even a book based on
  the account. This timeline of his movies shows the critical reception and
  financial reception (budget and box office numbers) of each of his movies.
  Only in two occasions has his budget exceeded the box office amount - his
  first movie, Bottle Rocket and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. <br />
  <br /> This ode to the director also celebrates his skillful use of color -
  hovering on a movie briefly changes the color scheme of the visualization to
  that of a chosen scene from the movie.
