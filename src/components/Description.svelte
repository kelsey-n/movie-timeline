<div class="title">Wes Anderson: Many Hits, Few Misses<br /><br /></div>
<div class="text">
  Wes Anderson's masterful eye for crafting a scene is evident in all of his
  movies. His style has become iconic, spawning instagram accounts, imitators,
  articles, and in-depth analyses. <br />
  <br />
  This timeline of his movies shows the reception of each - both critical (Rotten
  Tomatoes score) and financial (box office vs. budget). On only two occasions did
  his budget exceed the amount reaped from the box office - his first movie,
  <em>Bottle Rocket</em>, and <em>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</em>.
  <br />
  <br /> This ode to the director also celebrates his skillful use of color.
